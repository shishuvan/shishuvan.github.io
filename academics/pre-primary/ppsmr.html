<h3>Students of Shishuvan experience a blast of energy!!!<h3>
<p>  To experience speed ,fun ,adventure and motion students of  Jr.kg were taken to enjoy the monorail ride.The teachers of shishuvan put their efforts to make children understand modes of transportation with a real life experience which students, parents and teachers alike enjoyed to the fullest. A week before the ride the air smelled of excitement, joy and full of hush murmurs. During the monorail ride, the normally noisy children miraculously were disciplined, organized and quiet which made it easy for the teachers to handle them. The views and opinions of the children differed, some were not at all scared while some had their hearts in their mouths especially when this extra fast train which they called as their superman neared the curves and turns. But after all, all of them enjoyed the ride thoroughly. Shishuvan encourages each individual to throw out their fears , regard obstacles as stepping stones and to learn not only from text books but also experience it so that everyone can be a better person in life.
