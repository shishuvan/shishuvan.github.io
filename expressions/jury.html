<h1>Being a Jury</h1>
 <p><br>I still remember those days when I was the jury for the half-ticket jury
 <br>(children&#39;s jury) at the MUMBAI FILM FESTIVAL.
 <br>It all started from the school. It was a regular afternoon and our Maths
 <br>period was going on. In the middle of the period, I was called to the
 <br>High school HOD office. I was a bit anxious to why was I called. I was
 <br>a bit nervous and scared. As I headed towards my destination along with
 <br>my classmate Tanvi&#44; my head was buzzing of with thoughts. To my surprise&#44;
 <br>we were selected to write a film review that we had to send to the MAMI Mumbai
 <br>film festival team.I never knew that this opportune given by the school could lead me to
 <br>something unexpected. Thinking it was some just normal sort of
 <br>competition or a local festival&#44; I wrote review on the movie
 <br>&#44; &#34;Home Alone&#34; and send sent it to the film festival team. After a month&#44;
 <br>I received a call from my teacher(Prachi) and this is what she said
 <br>&#44; &#34; Congratulations Hetansh&#33; You have been selected for the next level
 <br>for the review you wrote.&#34; The next level was an interview.
 <br>The film festival team shortlisted 14 jurors from all over Mumbai
 <br>to be a part of the Mumbai film festival and I was one of them. I just
 <br>could not resist myself and finally that day arrived. The film festival
 <br>started with an opening ceremony. Many directors&#44; actors and celebrities
 <br>were present at the ceremony. I just could not believe everything I saw&#33; Not only
 <br>did I meet these people&#44; I interacted with them too&#33; One of my favorite personality&#44
 <br>Javed Akhtar was also present and we had a 15 minute long conversation.
 <br>All of us were introduced among the juries. This was followed by two days
 <br>of reviewing films. We saw ten short animated as well as live-action films that
 <br>were rare and out of the box. After reviewing and analyzing them&#44; we chose the
 <br>best three films to give the awards. It was a very different experience- I had
 <br>never seen such an exotic variety of films from different countries and in different languages.
 <br>I am proud to be in this school where we get a higher level of opportunities.
 <br>The film appreciation club in our schools took my reviewing skills to new heights.


<br>(I had got this opportunity in 7th std)
<br>HETANSH VISARIA &#44;8TH KARMA ROLL&#44; NO.14

<br>Imagine yourself alone at your home. It would be so interesting&#44; you could do things that you are not allowed to&#33;
Maybe you would gobble up all the candies or relax in your bathtub or maybe turn it into a pet house&#33;
Home alone is a comedy adventurous film where 8 year old Kevin is forgotten by his family at home when they go for a vacation.
Kevin&#39;s brother shows him a suspicious man and  he believes  him as a criminal. Unfortunately &#44;
Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) is forgotten by his family and so the responsibility of his house is on him. He freaks out and
 definitely does everything he wants. The fun  soon turns into a hazard when he finds out  2 thieves &#44;Harry and Marv
 (Joe Pesci &#44; Daniel Stern)who intend   to ransack his house. The thieves are soon outwitted by Kevin&#39;s smart tricks.
 This is the funniest part as the thieves experience electric shocks&#44; burning&#44; tripping and injuries. It seems very serious
 but is depicted very beautifully in a very funny manner which will get your belly laugh. It&#39;s not over&#44; the thieves finally
 get a hold of him.There&#39;s a very surprising twist when the suspicious man comes to his rescue and the two rascals are arrested.
 This movie is a very good example to show the relation between him and his mom as she is concerned about him and despite
 of plane tickets being unavailable&#44; she comes home by road. This movie personally has taught me a lot of things never judge
 somebody by their external appearance and never underestimate anyone.
Coming to the technical and setup part&#44; I feel it&#39;s nice that they have set up each small detail. The film is shot on a
 row of lonely streets with good clarity even in low light scenes. It&#39;s really awesome when different angles are shown so
 it feels more real and lively. Also the traps are easy but hazardous and are set with simple materials thus&#44; showing lot
 of creativity. Each thing including marbles is used wisely.
Every time I see it&#44; I feel very active and I imagine myself as Kevin. The most memorable scene is seeing the
thieves in trouble&#44; especially the chicken feather part. The parental relation in the film reminds of my childhood
and each every moment with my parents. I was about to close my eyes when Harry was about to cause harm to Kevin but
then all of sudden entry of the suspicious man made me engross in the movie. I also noticed a trap while watching the film
second time which I could not previously due to distraction. After watching this movie I have experienced a change in my life.
I judge people not on physical factors but their moral values and attitude. I relate it with a childhood incident, during my
kindergarten days&#44; there was a person who worked with children and I had an impression that she would kidnap children. This
superstition of mine was proved wrong when I was injured and she was there to help me. I also enjoy baby&#39;s day out in which
the story is similar but just Kevin is replaced by a baby. The baby crawls through dangerous building sites etc. but instead
the thieves behind him are affected instead of the baby and it&#39;s really funny.
I recommend this for all age groups and I assure you will have a gala time watching it. Happy homing alone!!!
