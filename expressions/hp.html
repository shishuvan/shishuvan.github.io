<h2>IDEA FROM AN EXTRA CLASS</H2>
<h4>an amazing experience wrote by Siddharth</H4>
<p>We had this amazing creative writing session with Yashvi Gada. We were discussing on the topic of Harry Potter, when I came up with this crazy idea for an unimaginably super-duper crazy interview with You-Know-Who.(Harry Potter of course)
</p>
<p>Guess what happened when Harry Potter came to India.Simple. He was literally drowned in a gigantic wave of paparazzi.Here is an extract from their conversation:-
</p>
<p>
Paparazzi: So what do you think of your name?
</p>
<p>Harry Potter: Insulting. I mean, everybody says I should be making pots, because that is what a 'Potter' does.
</p>
<p>Paparazzi: Ha.Ha. Tell me . What did you do on your first day in Hogwarts?
</p>
<p>Harry Potter: I laughed. I thought they would turn me into those despicable hogs and infect me with revolting 
warts.
</p>
<p>Paparazzi: What do you have to say about your ability to speak to snakes?
</p>
<p>Harry Potter: It does come in handy. But when I first spoke to a snake, I knew the words, but not the meanings(not true in the book). I picked up random words and blabbered them like a maniac. When I finished my sentence, the snake laughed. Only I  saw it. I figured out later that it meant-"I have potassium nitrate in my cow dung soup." I know, very funny. Hilarious even. But you really cannot blame me. When I spoke to another snake, it laughed harder than the previous one. I figured out later that it meant-" I have potassium nitrate in my donkey-dung filled diaper. Really I don't know what's up potassium nitrate and all sorts of dung.
</p>
<h5>Paparazzi DIES of laughter.</h5>
<p>If you read the entire conversation, you'd be laughing your heads off, and I really do not want you to be kind of beheaded by ME, because I'm completely INNOCENT.
