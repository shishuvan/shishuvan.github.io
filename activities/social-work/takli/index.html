          <h1>INTRODUCTION TO THE KHADI CLASSES AT SHISHUVAN</h1>
		  <h4>Spinning :Every student has to spin 1000 metres of <br>
		  good quality thread on the Takli, before getting to level<br>
		  2, which is the charkha.Level 2: At the second level, the<br>
		  student spins 1000 metres of thread on the charkha.<br>
		  Weaving :Every student weaves a towel-size cloth on a table-loom.<br>
		  Shishuvan is proud of its Khadi uniform in yellow and green,<br>
		  relating with our school symbol, thesunflower that turns its<br> 
		  bright face to the sun at all times.</h4>

		  <h2>"The wearer of Khadi is like a man making use of his lungs. <br>
		  A natural and obligatory act has got to be performed, whether<br>
		  others do it out of impure motives or refrain altogether because<br>
		  they do not believe in its necessity or utility." 
																- M. K. Gandhi</h2>
		  <p>With deference to the Mahatma's 
		  wishes, we at Shishuvan include a Khadi curriculum to enable students<br>
		  to understand and appreciate the production of Khadi cloth from which <br>
		  their uniform is made. The aim of the curriculum is to inculcate a respect<br>
		  for skilled labour and develop a meditative focus and attention <br>
		  in our students, in line withe Gandhi's nai talim". The teachers are<br>
		  from a voluntary Gandhian group : the Mumbai Sarvodaya Mandal.<br>
		  The unique corollary of teachers from this group is that it enables children to<br>
		  learn from elders that are the age of their grandparents or even older!</p>
		  <br>
		  <h2>Highlights of our school uniform include</h2>
		  <br>
		  <p>Unisex : The pant and kurta are worn by boys and girls, establishing their<br>
		  status as a STUDENT rather than emphasising their gender and giving the girls<br>
		  the same sense of freedom as the boys in their ability to sit, exercise, run and climb.<br>
		  <br>
		  Design : The design of the uniform provides maximum coverage to the body, keeping <br>
		  away harsh sunlight, mosquitoes, and lending itself to rural field visits wherein<br>
		  children walk through grass. Over time, there develops a certain comfort with looking and<br> 
			feeling Indian.<br>
			Durable : To provide ease of maintenance to parents, 30% polyester was accepted as the <br>
			minimal requirement to ensure colour fast cloth that is easy to wash and iron. Also,<br>
			parents are advised on the detergents to be used and the process of washing and drying<br>
			the uniform.<br>
			Climate appropriate : The uniform is 70% cotton thus making it sweat absorbent and making<br> 
			it easy for the skin to 'breathe'.Supporting women's livelihood : The uniform is manufactured<br>
			by a women's cooperative - "Udyog Bharati" at Gondal. The school has a unique relationship with<br> 
			the women who spin and weave the uniform cloth. Std V students visit Gondal every year, to meet<br>
			thesewomen, visit their homes and develop a social consciousness of how their uniform contributes<br>
			to the monthly income of thes economically deprived homes.<br>
			Quality focus : The choice of Udyog Bharati was based on its drive for quality as one of India's<br>
			largest exporters of Khadi.<br>
			Teamwork : The uniform celebrates the	coming together of Shishuvan, Udyog Bharati, TexLab -<br> 
			Ahmedabad and the Textiles departmentof Nirmala Niketan College, Mumbai, all driven by a strong<br>
			determination and working on each ones' strengths and core	competencies.</p>
