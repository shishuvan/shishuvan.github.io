		 <a class="ParaTitle"><strong>Clay And Pottery </strong></a>
		  <p>Clay and Pottery classes will be conducted by Mr. Satish  Joshi. He has been conducting Clay club for Shishuvan secondary students for  the last three years. </p>
		  <p> Through these sessions, students will get an idea of  techniques of clay molding, making handmade clay articles. <br>
		    </p>
		  <p><em>Advantages  of Clay workshop:</em></p>
		  <p>1. Beneficial for developing motor skills: Children pound,  pinch, flatten, tear, poke, squeeze, coil, roll and bend their clay into all  sorts of shapes and sizes. This is an excellent way to improve dexterity and  strengthen large and fine motor skills</p>
		  <p>		    2. Clay is Therapeutic: Clay is a wonderful tactile medium  that can be very calming for both children and adults. Manipulating the clay  can be an outlet for children to convey their emotions and reduce stress.</p>
		  <p> 3. Self-esteem: Clay is quick to mold and children feel they  are in charge of the medium. This feeling gives them the confidence to  communicate their vision. Once children learn to express their personal visions  in clay, they can be empowered in ways that go far beyond the art room.</p>
		  <p>4.  Creative problem solving: Playing with clay stimulates children&rsquo;s imaginations.  Children playing with clay can experiment with building techniques and adapt to  change along the way. This type of learning promotes problem-solving skills. </p>
