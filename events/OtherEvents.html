		<p> <img src="OtherEvents/OtherEvents_20150210A.jpg"></p>
        <p>Greetings from Junoon! </p>
		<p>We are delighted to bring to you, in collaboration with Goethe-Institut/Max-Mueller Bhavan Mumbai and Sitara Studio, a delightful play without words for young children between ages 2 to 8.</p>

		<p>The Show H 2 O explores and celebrates the enormous power, sputtering joy and sparkling life of water – as a melting ice-block, shimmering fountain, element of sound, reflector of light. Continuously giving new form to water, the show generates poetry and evokes the wonder of life. And it all starts with a single drop … !</p>

		<p>The Group Helios Theatre is a professional group of artists, musicians, puppeteers and players who develop performance for children 2 years up to young people and adults. As part of a larger tour covering Delhi, Karachi, Teheran, Pune, Chennai, Mumbai, Bangalore, Colombo and Dhaka, the team touches down in Mumbai to delight us with their magical show H 2 O, based on water – an element we think we know everything about, but which continues to surprise scientists till date.</p>

<p> <b>Dear Patron,</b> <br>

<p> <b>What is the Reading Challenge? </b> <br>
The aim of the Reading Challenge is to encourage children to read and enjoy books, which will help them get a head start in life.

  <div style="margin:0px; display:none" id="divDesc20121204">

		<p> This year the SPROUTS Environment Trust's Earth Mela 2012 is going to be held on at the Maharashtra Nature Park Society (MNPS, Dharavi) under the Theme – `Green Economies'. It is a two-day mega-fest comprising a varied range of activities such as a Short-Film Festival, a Photo Exhibition-cum-sale, Workshops and Lecture-Demos, Nature Trails, Bicycle Rally & a Mini-Marathon to stalls of eco-friendly life-style and essential products, an elaborate Adventure Sports Arena and much much more… </p>

		<p>Opening on Dec 8 with a Nature Trail (7-9am) at the MNPS & a Bicycle Rally & Mini Marathon (7-9am) on Dec 9, the main event will be from 10am to 6pm on both days. </p>
        
        <p>Advance Registration Fees :Rs. 75 (one day) & Rs. 150 (two days) for Bonafide Students (< 21yrs) 
and Rs. 150 (one day) & Rs. 300(for two days) for adults. </p>

    <p> Spot registration for two days : Rs. 100 (one day) & Rs. 200(two days) for Students and Rs.175 (one day ) & Rs. 350 (two days) for adults. </p>
        
        <p> The Earth Mela has been reaching out to the masses over the last four years with themes such as Indian Forests, Wildlife of India, Biodiversity Conservation & Carbon Reversal Movement. The festival is aimed at providing awareness on nature, biodiversity, eco-friendly lifestyle options, green technologies and conservation actions through responsible decisions. </p>
        
        <p>The Mela has been found relevant and engrossing to participants of all age groups and backgrounds, right from tiny tots to corporate participants. Lectures, Poster Presentations and Workshops by eminent Environmentalists and young scientists will surely engross the adults. And the varied stalls and activities such as adventure sports arena and clay work or collage making by a deaf & mute artist will surely draw in applauds by the younger at heart. The huge variety of stalls will display eco-friendly products and services, such as Paper Mache products, artifacts made by tribal artisans, green technologies, recycling options and organic food stalls, which will help you make better choices in life. </p>
        
      <p>Thus clearly the Mela has interesting games and activities to engage kids and adults alike. The Mela has proven to generate environmentally involved citizens, which is the mandate of the organizers. The photography exhibition and nature trails will tingle your visual, aural and olfactory senses by taking you into regions less seen (forests, deserts, villages) and creatures rarely sighted. Thus helping you gain knowledge and awareness at the same time. The Cycle rally, Mini Marathon and Adventure Sports arena help spread the message of trying out healthier options of transport, vacationing and daring to explore unchartered territories. </p>
        
        <p>The film festival will display a huge array of multi-lingual films dealing with social, cultural, energy, urbanization, wildlife, displacement and educational issues too – giving you an all-round understanding of the multi-dimensional element – we call Our Environment.
